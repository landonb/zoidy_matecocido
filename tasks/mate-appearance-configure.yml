    # upgrade? In any case, just be aware on next distro install:
    # - HINT: If mate-terminal has no border (which makes it hard to tell where
    # one window ends and another begins; and just looks bad in general), then
    # open Appearances from the Mint MATE menu, and customize the Window Border.
