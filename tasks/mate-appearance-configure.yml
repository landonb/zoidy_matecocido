    # - Note that "Mint-L-Dark" doesn't draw a window border, which makes it non-
    #   obvious what output belongs to which terminal when you have multiple
    #   overlapping terminal windows.
    # - Note the schema is not capitalized in dconf, i.e., "org/mate/marco/general".

      # - The Mint-L-Dark centers the title in the titlebar, between the left
      #   and right sides of the window, whereas the other Mint-L-Dark-* themes
      #   render the title a little leftward, between the left side of the window
      #   and the first window (control) button on the right-side of the window.
      # - The Mint-L-Dark-* themes appear different in two ways from Mint-L-Dark:
      #   - They affect the color of the active window's close button (but I
      #     don't see any other color highlights).
      #   - They draw a window border (so you can distinguish between, e.g.,
      #     multiple overlapping terminal window output).
